When I was trying to customized the PowerShell I noticed that the way we change the fonts for the not Admin PowerShell was different for Windows 11, here is how you do it.

First you need to right click on the navbar of the PowerShell to get the options.

Then click on settings.

Then select the PowerShell Profile, if you are no using PowerShell 7 select Windows PowerShell.

Then scroll down and select in Additional Settings the Appearance option,

And here you can select the font that you want to use for your terminal.
